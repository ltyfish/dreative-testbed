# Motion

Use motion to explain hierarchy, causality, continuity, or state.

Choose one motion language and one runtime owner. Prefer CSS for local states;
use GSAP only for coordinated choreography. Do not install a motion system for
fade/translate entrances.

Define resting, active, resolved, reverse/rapid-input where relevant, and a
purpose-designed reduced-motion form. Avoid continuous work offscreen.

For scroll stories, verify slow, normal, and rapid wheel input, reverse input,
at least 400ms of stable dwell after each key state settles, and a clean release
before the next section enters. Independent triggers that update text and imagery must
share one authored progress model or demonstrate that they remain synchronized.

Reject universal fade-ups, decorative hover scaling, sticky scenes with weak
release, and motion that makes the product slower to reach. Read
`../references/CREATIVE_EXECUTION.md` before adding a runtime and one matching
recipe only after selecting the mechanism.
