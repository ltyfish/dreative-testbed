# Dreative Specialist Skill — Media as Motion Material

Load this file when `plan.skills` includes `media`, when the plan's blueprint
contains any `generate-*` media cell, or when the brief involves imagery/video
on a page with motion dial ≥ 6. It EXTENDS DESIGN.md §7 (sourcing priority and
bans still apply) and STACKS with motion.md (timing), 3d.md (shader craft), and
cinematic.md (the living surface). This file exists because agents know how to
*embed* media but not how to *use* it: award-grade sites (unseen.co family)
treat images and video as the raw material the motion system acts on — media is
choreographed, distorted, revealed, and lit, never just placed.

## 0. The doctrine

- **The static-placement ban (any dial, whenever this file is loaded).** A
  generated or supplied image dropped in as `background-image`, a full-bleed
  `<img>` behind text, or a card thumbnail with zero behavior is a FAILURE of
  this skill, not a baseline. Every media element ships with at least one
  living quality — an entrance from §2/§2.5 (curtain, strip-slice, pixel/dither
  develop, print develop, fade-sweep…), an idle (loop, drift, ken-burns), or a
  response (hover wake, directional wipe, cursor torch, distortion). "Static on
  purpose" is allowed only when written into the plan blueprint with a reason
  (e.g. evidence screenshots in a refined register). At dial ≥ 8 with a canvas,
  media belongs on media planes (§3) moving in depth — parallax layers, curved
  sheets, velocity distortion — not pasted flat behind the DOM.
- **Sourced media is media.** Everything in this file applies equally to
  images/video that were generated, supplied by the user, or sourced from
  stock/CDN when no generation tool exists — "we had no image-gen" changes the
  PRODUCTION path (§1), never the treatment obligations. A picsum/stock photo
  dropped in flat is the same failure as a generated one.
- **The zoom/fade floor is a floor, not a treatment plan.** Fade-in entrances
  plus ken-burns idles on every image = the minimum-compliance page, and at
  motion dial ≥ 6 it FAILS this skill: at that dial, hero + key section
  imagery each need at least one treatment that is scroll- or cursor-DRIVEN
  (curtain synced to type, strip-slice, inner-zoom parallax, directional hover
  wipe, cursor torch, velocity distortion, media plane — §2/§2.5/§3), where
  the visitor's input visibly pushes the media. Ken-burns-everywhere is the
  refined register's budget (refined.md), nobody else's.
- **One media SET-PIECE per page (dial ≥ 7 / expressive+).** Beyond the
  per-image floors, the page needs one moment where imagery itself IS the
  spectacle — a composed §2.5 exotic (or an invention in its spirit) that a
  visitor would describe to someone else: an image tornado/vortex the scroll
  spins through, a hero that disintegrates into particles as you scroll past,
  a gallery that shatters and reassembles, a melt/liquid exit between
  chapters. Quiet treatments (curtain, parallax, ken-burns) on every image
  with no set-piece = the page failed this skill even though each image
  technically "moves". The set-piece is named in the plan blueprint like a
  signature element, ONE per page (two set-pieces compete; refined register
  may skip with a stated reason). **At dial ≥ 8 / award tier the set-piece
  must transform the media at PIXEL level** — the image's own content visibly
  changes under scroll/input, not just its placement. Qualifying classes:
  particle/point-grid decomposition, shader displacement/dissolve/melt,
  scroll-scrubbed frame sequences, slice/shatter of the bitmap, live texture
  feedback or refraction, and the §3.5 immersion recipes (portal dive,
  depth-map dive, diorama, particle fly-through, scrub-dive). **At award-site
  ambition the default set-piece IS a §3.5 dive** — one moment where the
  visitor goes INTO an image or video rather than watching it move; choose a
  different pixel-transforming class only when a stated ASSET impossibility is
  recorded in the plan (no depth-capable asset exists AND none can be
  generated — with image-gen available this reason is almost never true, since
  a depth-capable composition can be prompted). Brand fit, taste, or "this
  concept links better" is NOT a valid skip reason: a masked reveal or curtain
  chosen over the dive on preference grounds fails the award-tier check. Choreographing whole rectangles (orbit, collapse,
  card fly-ins, grid reflow) is composition, not a set-piece at this tier —
  it may accompany one, never substitute for it. Evidence at verify: the
  sampled shader uniform / particle count / frame index changing with scroll.
- **Treatment classes, and a coverage floor at award tier.** Treatments split
  into two classes. QUIET class moves the rectangle or its window: curtain,
  inner-zoom parallax, ken-burns, hover wipe, strip entrance, floating drift.
  PIXEL class changes the image's own content: slice/shatter, particle
  disintegration or assembly, UV distortion/melt/ripple, RGB split, mosaic/
  pixel-assembly, living overlay, cursor torch, depth-map parallax, terrain
  displacement, tornado/vortex, frame scrub, print develop. **At dial ≥ 8 /
  award-site, ONE set-piece is not the whole show: at least half of the
  hero + key section images (minimum 3, set-piece included) carry a
  PIXEL-class treatment, each a DIFFERENT mechanism** — and the HERO image
  is always one of them: the hero is the page's first impression and is
  never the designated rest. Quiet class is
  reserved for the intensity curve's designated rest sections, chosen as
  rests on purpose. "Key image" is MECHANICAL, not discretionary: every
  image that occupies ≥ 25% of the viewport at any scroll position, plus
  the largest image of every blueprint section whose intensity is ≥ 5,
  counts — the denominator is fixed by the blueprint, and reclassifying
  images as "not key" to shrink it is the same self-grading this floor
  exists to stop (a repeated card-grid pattern counts as ONE image for the
  tally, treated uniformly). EXEMPT from the tally: prop/item cutouts —
  transparent-background object images seeded as scene props or product
  shots (§1.5) — which follow §1.5's behavior rules instead; the floor
  governs scenic/editorial imagery, not the objects living in the layout. A page that is one set-piece plus curtains everywhere
  else reads exactly as static as no set-piece at all, and fails this floor.
  (Below dial 8 the §0 zoom/fade-floor and set-piece rules stand unchanged —
  this floor is what "award" buys.)
- **Edit the asset, don't just place it.** Generation is step one; the pipeline
  (§1) continues with real editing — grade/duotone to the palette, crop to the
  blueprint's aspect, cut video to the loop point, extract posters and frame
  sequences, composite masks/mattes (ffmpeg/sharp or your image tools). An
  asset that arrives on the page exactly as the generator emitted it usually
  reads as wallpaper.
- **No bare media at dial ≥ 7.** Every meaningful image/video gets three
  decisions: an **entrance** (how it arrives — reveal, wipe, materialize), an
  **idle** (what it does at rest — loop, drift, ken-burns, nothing-on-purpose),
  and a **response** (what interaction does to it — hover wake, distortion,
  parallax). "None" is a valid answer per axis, but it must be chosen, not
  defaulted.
- **Media and type arrive as one beat.** Time the media entrance with the
  section's line-mask type reveal (motion.md §4) — image and headline landing
  together reads as choreography; landing separately reads as two plugins.
- **One treatment vocabulary per page.** Pick 1-2 media treatments and stamp
  them consistently (all work cards hover-wake; all section images curtain-
  reveal). Five different reveal styles = assembled, not designed.
- **Invent, don't pick.** §2/§3 are springboards, not a menu — the signature
  media treatment should be COMPOSED for this brand and this prompt using the
  grammar in §2.5 (a torn-paper archive scrolls differently than a liquid
  fashion film). Stock-vocabulary media reads as template exactly like stock
  layouts do; if the user's prompt describes an effect ("images tear apart on
  scroll"), build THAT effect for real, at the tier it needs.
- **Real assets outrank generated ones** (DESIGN.md §7). Generated media fills
  gaps and creates atmosphere; it never replaces the client's product shots.

## 1. Production pipeline (generate → grade → compress)

When the plan calls for generated media, produce it BEFORE section code
(PLAN.md §4) and produce it correctly:

- **Prompt for the world, grade for the page.** Prompt the brand's physical
  subject (DESIGN.md §7) PLUS the page's light: temperature ("warm tungsten
  side-light", "cool overcast daylight"), palette anchors ("deep green shadows,
  bone highlights"), and grain/mood. Every asset on a page shares ONE lighting
  logic — mismatched light is the #1 generated-media tell.
- **Exact aspect ratios** from the blueprint (16:9 hero, 4:5 cards, 1:1
  thumbnails, 21:9 banners). Never generate square and crop-hope.
- **Video loops**: 5-10s, prompt explicitly for seamlessness ("seamless loop,
  continuous motion, no scene change") and slow motion content (drift, steam,
  fabric, water — fast action never loops cleanly). Generate or extract a
  **poster frame** for every video (first frame, same grade).
- **Image sequences** for scroll scrubs: 40-80 frames of one continuous
  transformation (assemble/rotate/morph). Image-to-video tools can produce
  these from a single generated still; export frames with ffmpeg
  (`ffmpeg -i loop.mp4 -vf fps=12,scale=1280:-1 frames/f_%03d.webp`).
- **Compress before committing**: images → WebP/AVIF at the largest displayed
  size ×2 max; video → H.264 + AV1 sources, CRF ~28-32, no audio track, ≤ 2-4MB
  per loop (`ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -an -c:v libx264 -crf 30 -movflags +faststart`).
  A 40MB hero loop fails the plan even if it's beautiful.
- Textures too: grain tiles, masks, mattes, displacement maps — generate them
  instead of hand-rolling SVG (which is banned, DESIGN.md §7).
- **Asset manifest (`.dreative/assets.json`) — generation is expensive; never
  pay twice.** Before generating anything, read the manifest; an entry whose
  prompt/aspect/grade matches the need means REUSE the file, don't regenerate.
  After each generation+edit, append one entry:
  `{ "file": "assets/hero-loop.mp4", "kind": "video-loop", "prompt": "<the
  exact generation prompt>", "aspect": "16:9", "grade": "warm tungsten, deep
  green shadows", "poster": "assets/hero-poster.webp", "bytes": 2400000 }`.
  A re-run, a mockup→build transition, or a resumed session regenerates only
  what the manifest doesn't already have.

## 1.5 Custom props (isolated compositional elements)

Distinct from hero/gallery media (§1-2, which fill a frame): a **prop** is a
small, isolated object — a single coffee bean, a steam wisp, a leaf, a bottle,
an icon-scale object — used as scattered COMPOSITION around content, not as
the content itself. Props are what make a page feel art-directed rather than
stocked with rectangles; they're cheap to generate/build and reused as a
recurring motif across sections (the visual equivalent of a signature element,
motion.md's terms).

Two flavors — pick per section from the blueprint, they can mix on one page:

- **Cutout image props**: with no image-gen tool, source instead of generate —
  a verified real photo of the subject, matted to transparency (rembg / sharp /
  ImageMagick if available); if no photo source and no matting path exists, the
  prop is cut, never approximated with coded organic geometry (3d.md §3 rung 4).
  When generating: generate on a transparent background — prompt
  explicitly ("isolated on pure transparent background, studio product
  lighting, no backdrop, no shadow baked in") and REQUEST alpha-channel PNG
  output. **Verify the alpha is real**, not a white/checkerboard fill the
  model painted in: sample a corner pixel programmatically or view at 100%
  over a colored backdrop — a prop with a faint white halo is a failed
  generation, regenerate or matte it out (rembg/similar if available). Add a
  drop shadow / contact shadow yourself in CSS (`filter: drop-shadow(...)`),
  never bake it into the generation — a baked shadow breaks when the prop
  moves or the section behind it changes color.
- **3D props**: when a prop lives inside a WebGL scene, the DEFAULT is still a
  cutout image — on a billboard plane per 3d.md §3 rung 2 (alpha-tested plane,
  parallax + damped rotation + contact shadow), which is photoreal by
  construction. Coded geometry is reserved for ABSTRACT prop shapes (shards,
  ribbons, orbs-as-design-objects) and must carry a real textured material per
  `experimental.md` §1 (generated albedo + bump/roughness map, rim light,
  environment reflection) — never model an organic real object (bean, leaf,
  bottle…) from primitives; 3d.md §3 bans it. Either flavor is reusable: the
  SAME prop instanced multiple times (different scale/rotation) reads as a
  coherent motif, not repetition.

Placement and behavior:

- Compose as a **floating layer** (§2's floating-media technique) around
  content: corners, margins, trailing a section's edge — never covering the
  content's readable area. 3-6 instances per page is a motif; more reads as
  clutter.
- Give props real behavior, same floors as any media (§0): idle drift/rotate,
  parallax depth differential, and at least one response (cursor-follow with
  lag, scroll-linked rotation, hover nudge, scatter-and-reform on scroll
  velocity). A prop that just sits pinned in a corner is decoration nobody
  asked for; a prop that visibly reacts is what sells the "crafted" feel.
- One prop VOCABULARY per page — pick one subject family (all beans/leaves/
  steam, not a random mix of unrelated objects) and one behavior language, the
  same discipline as §0's "one treatment vocabulary" rule.
- Record each in the asset manifest (§1) with `"kind": "prop-image"` or
  `"kind": "prop-3d"` — props get reused across sections, never regenerated
  per-section.

## 2. DOM-tier treatments (no WebGL — the budget vocabulary)

80% of the effect at 5% of the cost; the right tier below dial 8 or without a
canvas already on the page. All honor the floors in §5.

- **Curtain / inset reveal**: media enters behind a wipe —
  `clip-path: inset(100% 0 0 0) → inset(0)` (or 2-4 panel slides), 900ms
  expo-out, triggered in-view once, synced to the headline's line-mask.
- **Hover-woken loop**: still poster crossfades to its video loop on
  hover/focus (240ms), `video.play()` on enter, pause + reset to poster on
  leave. The "living thumbnail" for work/product cards. Preload `metadata`
  only; play() only after the crossfade starts.
- **Mask-shaped video**: the loop plays inside display type
  (`background-clip: text` on 10vw+ headlines), an arch/circle `clip-path`, or
  the brand mark (SVG mask). Video becomes identity, not a rectangle. One per
  page.
- **Floating media**: 3-5 images hovering in depth — slow damped drift
  (±6-10px, 4-8s loops, each phase-offset), parallax differential by depth
  layer, soft tinted contact shadow. The "paper sheets in space" look, pure CSS
  + one IntersectionObserver.
- **Ken-burns**: slow scale 1.0→1.06 over 12-20s inside a fixed frame,
  alternate direction per instance. The refined register's entire motion budget
  for imagery (refined.md).
- **Pixel/dither swap**: stepped `image-rendering: pixelated` downscale swap
  (24px mosaic → full res in 4-6 steps) on scroll progress or hover. Digital-
  craft registers.
- **Inner-zoom parallax**: image at 115% height inside `overflow-hidden` frame,
  `object-position` or translateY driven by scroll (-8%→8%). Media moves, frame
  doesn't — never parallax the frame itself past text.
- **Scroll-scrubbed `<canvas>` sequence**: preload frames (§1), draw the frame
  for the current damped scroll progress; sticky wrapper ≤ 2.5 viewports
  (motion.md §7's scrub showcase). No WebGL needed.

## 2.5 The invention grammar (compose the signature treatment)

Every media effect — including any the user describes in their own words — is
three choices multiplied together. Compose deliberately:

- **PROPERTY** (what changes): position/scale · opacity · clip/mask SHAPE
  (inset, circle, arch, brand mark, jagged polygon) · slices/fragments (the
  media cut into strips, tiles, or shards that move independently) · UV
  distortion (WebGL: ripple, stretch, melt, swirl) · resolution (mosaic →
  sharp) · color channels (RGB split, duotone → full color) · blend/exposure
  (media develops like a photo print).
- **DRIVER** (what pushes it): scroll progress (scrubbed) · scroll VELOCITY
  (agitation that decays) · in-view trigger (one-shot) · hover/focus ·
  cursor position within the element (directional!) · drag · hold · time.
- **SHAPE OF PROGRESSION** (how it travels across the media): uniform ·
  directional sweep (left→right, top→bottom) · radial from a point (often the
  cursor's entry point) · per-slice stagger · noise-mask (organic, torn) ·
  along the brand mark's silhouette.

The user's prompt usually fixes one or two axes; you compose the rest from the
brand's world. "Tearing" = slices + jagged noise-mask edges, driven by scroll.
"Video fades from left to right on hover" = opacity/mask, hover-driven,
directional sweep — a gradient `mask-image` whose position animates, 400ms,
from the edge the cursor entered. Name the composed treatment in the plan
blueprint like a signature element, and stamp it consistently (§0).

**Worked exotics (copy the construction, not the skin):**

- **Paper tear on scroll**: image duplicated into 2-3 layers, each clipped by
  a jagged `clip-path` polygon sharing torn edges; scroll progress translates/
  rotates the pieces apart (±2-6°) with a hairline of background showing
  through; WebGL version displaces UV along a noise seam. Archive/editorial/
  punk registers.
- **Strip-slice reveal**: media as 5-9 vertical strips (repeated
  `background-image` with offset `background-position`, or plane-per-strip);
  strips slide in staggered from alternating directions, or shear on scroll
  velocity. The classic award-site gallery entrance.
- **Directional hover wipe**: detect the pointer's entry edge (compare
  enter coordinates to bounds); the reveal (opacity mask, color→duotone,
  still→video crossfade) sweeps FROM that edge. Feels alive because it
  answers the gesture's direction.
- **Cursor-torch reveal**: media sits dimmed/blurred/halftoned; a radial mask
  tracking the (damped) cursor reveals it sharp and graded — the flashlight
  over an archive. Pair with a "drag to explore" label.
- **Melt/liquid exit**: on section leave or route change, UV y-displacement
  grows by a noise column pattern — the image drips out of frame (WebGL), or
  budget version: per-strip translateY with eased random offsets.
- **Shatter/scatter**: media as an instanced tile grid (WebGL) that explodes
  along scroll velocity and reassembles at rest — the §3 plane system with a
  per-instance offset uniform; cap tiles ≤ 400.
- **Image tornado / vortex**: 8-20 image cards on a helical path (WebGL
  planes, or DOM: `rotateY` + translate on a cylinder via per-card
  `--angle`), scroll progress spins and tightens/loosens the helix; cards
  face the camera (billboard) or shear with velocity. Entry/exit: cards fly
  in from scatter, settle into the vortex, then one card breaks out and
  expands into the next section's hero. Gallery/archive/portfolio registers;
  damp the spin (never raw-set), cap DPR, poster fallback.
- **Disintegration on scroll/click**: the image dissolves into particles that
  drift away along scroll direction — WebGL: draw the texture as a point grid
  (one point per NxN texel block, ≤ 10k), scroll/click drives `uProgress`
  which displaces points along noise + directional velocity while alpha
  fades; reverse the uniform to reassemble. Budget DOM version: the image
  sliced into a coarse tile grid, tiles translate/rotate/fade with staggered
  randomized offsets. Click-to-destroy variants pair with a rebuild on
  scroll-back — destruction must be reversible, content is never lost.
- **Pixel assembly on scroll**: the reverse of disintegration as an ENTRANCE —
  the image begins as scattered pixel blocks/particles (WebGL point grid ≤10k,
  or DOM: a coarse tile grid at randomized scatter positions/rotations) and
  scroll progress converges them into the finished picture; `uProgress` lerps
  each point from its noise-scattered origin to its texel home, alpha ramping
  up, optionally staggered radially or along a directional sweep. Pair with
  the headline resolving in the same beat. Scroll-back re-scatters
  (reversible). Variants: assemble from RGB-split ghosts converging, from
  mosaic chunks sharpening (§2 pixel swap driven per-tile), or from another
  image's dispersed particles (image A dissolves → its particles re-form as
  image B: a particle CROSSFADE between chapters).
- **Pixel sort / smear on velocity**: scroll velocity smears the image's
  pixels along one axis (shader: offset UV lookup by per-column noise ×
  velocity, or stretch bright bands glitch-style), decaying to sharp at rest
  — agitation that answers the visitor's speed. Digital/editorial registers.
- **Halftone/ASCII materialize**: media enters as its own halftone dots,
  scanlines, or character grid and resolves to the photograph on scroll or
  in-view — resolution as narrative. Budget: CSS `mask` with a dot pattern
  scaling down; full: a LUT/threshold shader ramping cell size to zero.
- **Living overlay**: a shader/canvas layer ON TOP of the media that reacts
  while the image stays legible beneath — flowfield streaks along the
  subject's edges, scanline/glitch bursts on scroll velocity, a displacement
  ripple radiating from the cursor, halftone dots that swell near the
  pointer. The overlay is the same §3 plane sampling the same texture —
  never a second copy of the asset.
- **Print develop**: media enters as paper-white → exposure/contrast/duotone
  ramps to full grade (CSS `filter` keyframes or a LUT shader), timed with
  the headline reveal. Photography/portfolio registers.

### The exploration protocol (run it before choosing anything)

The catalogs in this file are calibration, not a menu — the failure mode they
create is pattern-matching to the nearest listed effect. At dial ≥ 7, before
committing the media column of the blueprint, generate **three candidate
treatments that do not appear verbatim in this file**, each derived from the
brand's world (what does this subject physically DO? beans pour and tumble;
fabric folds and drapes; ink bleeds; glass refracts; records spin; steam
rises). Write the three candidates + the pick into the plan file with one
line each on construction cost. Pick the boldest one that clears §5's floors
and the register — if all three are weaker than a §2.5 exotic, use the
exotic, but the exploration must have happened. A media plan assembled purely
from listed effects, with no rejected invention on record, is minimum-effort
compliance.

### Exploration catalog (further constructions — steal the mechanics, reskin the idea)

Images beyond the frame:

- **Physics gallery**: images as draggable/throwable bodies (Rapier 2D or
  a spring sim) that collide, settle, and stack; scroll shakes the pile.
- **Infinite drag canvas**: a 2D plane of scattered media the visitor pans
  through (drag + inertia), items waking (scale/unblur/play) near the
  viewport center — the exploration-museum pattern.
- **Image as terrain**: the photo's luminance drives vertex displacement on
  a plane — the image becomes a relief the camera glides over on scroll.
- **Fake-3D depth parallax**: one still + a (generated or estimated) depth
  map; UV offset by depth × cursor/gyro = a photo with real parallax inside.
- **Cursor echo trail**: moving the cursor across a gallery leaves a decaying
  trail of image fragments/duplicates that fade behind it.
- **Collage assembly**: a section's imagery enters as scattered scraps
  (rotated, layered, torn edges) that scroll pulls into a composed collage —
  the reverse of disintegration.
- **Lens/magnifier**: a draggable optic over a large image or dense contact
  sheet, refracting (WebGL) or scaling (CSS) what's beneath.

Video beyond autoplay:

- **Scrub-as-transition**: a 1-2s generated clip scrubbed by route/section
  transition progress — the page change IS the video (door opens, liquid
  pours, light sweeps).
- **Video-lit scene**: sample the playing video's average/dominant color per
  frame (offscreen canvas) and drive ambient page tint/glow from it — the
  video becomes the room's light source.
- **Timeline flipbook**: N generated stills of one subject across time/states
  flipped by scroll — a bean roasting darker, a garment assembling — the
  narrative version of a scrub sequence.

Props beyond floating (§1.5 behaviors, upgraded):

- **Flocking swarms**: 20-80 instanced prop cutouts with boids/noise motion
  that scatter from the cursor and reform into a loose formation (or the
  brand mark's silhouette) at rest.
- **Pour/emit systems**: props emitted from a source object (beans from a
  bag, petals from a stem) on scroll or click, falling with gravity + drag,
  settling into a pile that persists per session.
- **Props as UI**: the prop IS the control — a bean that drags along a
  roast-level slider, a bottle that tilts to pour the page to the next
  section. One per page; must keep an obvious conventional equivalent.

Same law as §2.5: every construction here still clears §5's floors, earns one
sentence of communication value, and ONE set-piece per page — an exploration
catalog is not permission to ship five spectacles.

Discipline stays the law: the composed treatment must still clear §5's floors,
DESIGN.md §6's "one sentence of communication value", and one-signature-
per-page — an inventive effect stamped on every image is as loud as a marquee
on every section.

## 3. WebGL tier — the media plane (the unseen.co mechanic)

When dial ≥ 8 or cinematic/immersive is active, media renders THROUGH the
canvas so shaders can touch it. **At award-site ambition this section is a
REQUIREMENT, not an option**: the hero image and at least one gallery/section
image set must be live media planes whose shader visibly responds to scroll
(velocity distortion, dissolve, RGB split, curvature — pick from §2.5) — a
page whose images all sit in flat DOM rectangles has not met the tier, no
matter how much 3D floats around them. Verification must prove it: sample a
plane's driven uniform (e.g. `uVelocity`, `uProgress`) or its rect-synced
transform during a scripted scroll and record two differing values in
verify.md. The core pattern, in order:

1. **Sync planes to DOM rects.** Real `<img>`/`<video>` elements stay in the
   document (a11y, SEO, layout, fallback) but render invisible
   (`opacity: 0`, NOT `display:none` — layout must persist). For each, a
   textured plane in an orthographic/fitted scene copies its
   `getBoundingClientRect()` every scroll/resize (rAF-batched; lerp the
   position for the floaty feel). Texture from `TextureLoader` or
   `new THREE.VideoTexture(videoEl)` (video must be `muted playsinline` and
   playing; `texture.colorSpace = SRGBColorSpace`).
2. **Distortion in the fragment/vertex shader**, uniforms driven by input:
   - *Hover ripple/lens*: damped `uMouse` + `uHoverStrength` 0→1 spring; UV
     displacement by radial falloff or noise.
   - *Velocity stretch / RGB split*: scroll or drag velocity (from Lenis /
     `useScroll`) → vertex bend + per-channel UV offset, hard-clamped, damped
     decay to zero (cinematic.md §2). Peak effect at a fast flick stays legible.
   - *Transition dissolve*: two textures + noise mask `mix()` for gallery/
     route image swaps (3d.md §4).
3. **Curved/warped planes**: subtle vertex bend (unseen's floating paper
   sheets) — displace z by a small curve of UV.x + scroll velocity.

Rules: ONE media-plane system per page owning all planes (one scene, one rAF —
never a canvas per image); planes pause syncing when off-screen; the DOM
element remains the interaction target (click/focus/hover listeners on the DOM,
effects on the plane); reduced-motion and WebGL-failure both fall back to
simply un-hiding the DOM media (set `opacity: 1`) — this fallback must be
wired, not theoretical, and it's the first thing runtime verification checks.

## 3.5 Going INSIDE the media (immersion recipes)

The strongest media moment on the modern web is not looking AT an image —
it's the camera going INTO it: the photo stops being a rectangle on a page
and becomes, briefly, the space the visitor is in. These are the recipes,
cheapest first; at dial ≥ 8 with a canvas, prefer one of these as (or inside)
the set-piece over any flat treatment:

1. **The portal dive (DOM tier — no WebGL needed).** Pin the section; scroll
   scales the image from framed rectangle past 100% of the viewport while a
   `clip-path` aperture opens, until its interior IS the background — and the
   next section's content fades in already "inside" it (its palette sampled
   from the image's deep tones so the world feels continuous). Reverse on
   scroll-back. Layer 2-3 depth children (see recipe 3) inside the frame and
   the dive reads as truly spatial, not as a zoom.
2. **The depth-map dive (WebGL, the real thing).** Get a depth map for the
   image: generate one (prompt the image tool for "depth map of this scene,
   white near black far" alongside the still), or approximate from luminance/
   a vertical gradient for scenes with obvious near-ground/far-sky structure.
   Subdivided plane (~128×128), vertex shader displaces z by depth × uDolly;
   scroll drives the camera INTO the displaced relief (dolly + slight fov
   ease) while pointer shifts a ±3-5° parallax. Near pixels slide past the
   camera edges as you enter — that edge-slide is what sells "inside".
   Occlusion artifacts at the silhouette are hidden with fog/vignette matched
   to the image's palette.
3. **The diorama (matted layers).** Cut the image into 2-4 real layers
   (subject / midground / backdrop — matte with the §1.5 cutout pipeline, or
   generate the layers separately in the same prompt world). Place them at
   real z-depths (WebGL planes or CSS `translateZ` with perspective on the
   parent) and move the camera between them on scroll: passing a foreground
   layer's edge as it exits the frame is the moment the brain accepts depth.
   The generated-layers path beats matting: ask the image tool for the same
   scene as "foreground elements only, transparent background" + "empty
   background plate".
4. **The particle fly-through.** Build the image as a point cloud (§2.5
   disintegration budget: ≤ 10k points sampled from the texture, point size
   by luminance). Scroll doesn't just dissolve it — it drives the camera
   THROUGH the cloud: points ahead grow, pass the camera plane, and exit
   behind (kill/respawn them past z=camera). Halfway through, the cloud
   re-forms into the NEXT image — one continuous flight from picture to
   picture is a set-piece by itself.
5. **The scrub-dive (video/frames).** A scroll-scrubbed frame sequence
   (generate-sequence, or frames extracted from video via ffmpeg) whose
   camera already moves INTO the scene (prompt the generation that way:
   "dolly forward into…"); pin the section, map scroll → frame index
   (preload + draw to a canvas, never seek a `<video>` per frame), and the
   visitor's scroll finger literally walks the camera in. Exit the pin at
   the deepest frame into a section graded to that frame's palette.

Wiring rules: these are still media planes — DOM element stays for a11y and
the fallback is the graded flat image (§3's rules apply unchanged). ONE dive
per page (it's a set-piece-class moment; two dives cheapen both). The dive
target must be an image whose composition has actual depth to enter (a
corridor, a room, a landscape, machinery receding) — prompt/choose the asset
for that; diving into a flat-lit product shot reads as a zoom, which is the
failure this section replaces.

## 4. Choosing the treatment (the reasoning frame)

Per media element, walk this in one line each — it's the media ledger the plan
blueprint (PLAN.md §2) captures:

1. **Role**: hero atmosphere / product evidence / work-card / texture / story
   beat? Evidence media (screenshots, product photos) gets QUIET treatments —
   curtain reveal, ken-burns; atmosphere media can take the loud/invented ones.
2. **Tier**: does the page already pay for WebGL? If yes, media planes (§3);
   if no, a DOM treatment (§2) or the DOM construction of a §2.5 invention —
   never add a canvas only to distort one image.
3. **Entrance / idle / response** per §0, matched to register and dial.
4. **Failure path**: poster/static version named (reduced-motion, load
   failure, mobile tier).

## 5. Floors (every treatment, non-negotiable)

- `prefers-reduced-motion`: poster frame / static image, no autoplaying loops,
  no scrub (static end-state). Test by toggling it.
- Videos: `muted autoplay loop playsinline preload="metadata"` + `poster`;
  pause when off-screen (IntersectionObserver) and on `document.hidden`; no
  audio tracks ever on ambient loops.
- Loading: explicit `width/height` or `aspect-ratio` on every media box (zero
  CLS); LCP image/poster preloaded, everything below the fold lazy; a media box
  is never blank — poster, dominant-color fill, or blur-up while loading.
- Hover treatments have focus equivalents; touch gets the tap/visible-default
  story (DESIGN.md §13); media planes and canvases are `pointer-events-none`
  unless they ARE the control.
- Budgets: one video loop playing per view, ≤ 2-4MB per loop, sequences ≤
  ~6MB total, `dpr` capped on media-plane canvases (3d.md §7).
- Alt text carries voice on images; videos that convey content (not
  atmosphere) get a text alternative nearby.
