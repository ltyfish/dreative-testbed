# Native creative foundations

These twelve implementation-neutral foundations replace the former effect
catalogue. They are bounded production primitives, not finished art direction
or package-specific showcase builds, and they are not preferred substitutes
for mature specialist runtimes. Choose one only when it fully satisfies the
selected mechanism. Do not select a Native Foundation merely because it is
already available or easier to implement. For advanced choreography,
rendering, state orchestration, or smooth-scroll coordination, choose the
appropriate established runtime instead. Every mount owns one bounded root and
one cleanup path. `demo.html` is a functional visual fixture, not a house style.

## section-observer

- Export: `mountSectionObserver`
- Use: small reversible section states with visible-by-default content.
- Reject: repeated generic fade-ups.
- Mobile/reduced: shorten travel; resolve immediately under reduced motion.
- Budget/cleanup: one observer per route; disconnect it.
- Browser: enter, leave, reverse, 390px, reduced motion.

## scroll-progress

- Export: `mountScrollProgress`
- Use: one native signal shared by a meaningful progress/velocity treatment.
- Reject: decorative smoothness or competing scroll clocks.
- Mobile/reduced: clamp velocity; publish zero velocity under reduced motion.
- Budget/cleanup: one RAF only after scroll/resize; cancel and remove listeners.
- Browser: start/mid/end, reverse direction, resize, destroy.

## pinned-chapter

- Export: `mountPinnedChapter`
- Use: a real comparison or sequence with authored states and a safe release.
- Reject: pinning ordinary copy or trapping mobile scroll.
- Mobile/reduced: shorter sticky travel or normal vertical state sequence.
- Budget/cleanup: bounded state count; destroy the owned progress controller.
- Browser: entry, every state, reverse, release, 390px, reduced motion.

## shared-element-handoff

- Export: `runSharedElementHandoff`
- Use: the same semantic subject changes layout ownership.
- Reject: unrelated source/destination elements or a gratuitous page transition.
- Mobile/reduced: shorten or switch instantly; always preserve focus.
- Budget/cleanup: one transition at a time; no persistent runtime.
- Browser: focus, forward/back state, unsupported API fallback.

## frame-sequence

- Export: `mountFrameSequence`
- Use: pre-rendered motion is more faithful or efficient than runtime simulation.
- Reject: a short compressed video or two stills communicate the same result.
- Mobile/reduced: pass a smaller manifest when mounting; choose a resolved
  informative frame with `reducedFrame`.
- Budget/cleanup: capped DPR, bounded manifest/window, clear cached image refs.
- Browser: missing callback, resize, start/mid/end and reduced-motion frame.

## persistent-stage

- Export: `mountPersistentStage`
- Use: one meaningful subject develops through named section berths.
- Reject: floating decoration, control coverage, or unclear occlusion ownership.
- Mobile/reduced: the runtime disables the floating stage and marks each berth
  `data-stage-fallback="visible"`; author meaningful in-flow content there.
- Budget/cleanup: one stage; observe only berths; disconnect and remove resize.
- Browser: every berth, overlaps, resize, 390px, fallback content.

## drag-rail

- Export: `mountDragRail`
- Use: direct manipulation improves browsing a finite set.
- Reject: a standard list is clearer or drag is the only navigation.
- Mobile/reduced: native horizontal snap; no inertia under reduced motion.
- Budget/cleanup: pointer events only during interaction; release every handler.
- Browser: pointer, touch-equivalent scroll, arrow keys, bounds, focus.

## kinetic-type

- Export: `mountKineticType`
- Use: language itself carries hierarchy or transformation.
- Reject: decorative glyph noise, delayed reading, or broken copy/paste.
- Mobile/reduced: fewer groups; immediate readable resolution.
- Budget/cleanup: retain one accessible label; restore original text on destroy.
- Browser: accessibility name, wrap/resize, 390px, reduced motion, cleanup.

## adaptive-canvas

- Export: `mountAdaptiveCanvas`
- Use: dense interactive 2D work exceeds clean DOM/SVG handling; PixiJS is the
  enhanced path for sprites, 2D shaders, or filters.
- Reject: a few nodes suffice or the subject is genuinely 3D.
- Mobile/reduced: reduce count/DPR; draw one static frame or use DOM fallback.
- Budget/cleanup: DPR ≤ 1.5 by default; pause hidden; no per-frame allocations.
- Browser: resize, visibility pause, low-power form, fallback, destroy.

## video-handoff

- Export: `mountVideoHandoff`
- Use: information established in footage continues into editorial DOM.
- Reject: unrelated background loops.
- Mobile/reduced: poster/short derivative; immediate matched DOM.
- Budget/cleanup: compressed sources/poster; remove media handlers.
- Browser: readiness, end handoff, error, poster, reduced motion.

## spatial-gallery

- Export: `mountSpatialGallery`
- Use: bounded depth helps users understand or browse relationships; Three.js or
  R3F is the enhanced path when real camera/geometry is necessary.
- Reject: depth merely adds travel.
- Mobile/reduced: the runtime flattens depth; consumer CSS must turn the same
  items into a native snap rail when that is the chosen mobile form.
- Budget/cleanup: finite items, capped DPR in GPU enhancement, full disposal.
- Browser: click, arrows, focus, bounds, 390px, reduced motion.

## media-trail

- Export: `mountMediaTrail`
- Use: deliberate exploration reveals a short-lived trail of project imagery;
  PixiJS is the enhanced path for genuinely high counts.
- Reject: permanent cursor followers, control coverage, or stock imagery.
- Mobile/reduced: deliberate drag only; the runtime creates no trail under
  reduced motion, so preserve an authored still in the underlying content.
- Budget/cleanup: six items and 700ms life by default; remove nodes and handler.
- Browser: density bound, coarse pointer, controls, reduced motion, cleanup.

## Optional runtime routing

- Motion: React/component-state layout, enter/exit, hover, press, and drag.
- GSAP: coordinated, scrubbed, reversible DOM/SVG/WebGL choreography.
- Lenis: only when velocity or DOM/WebGL synchronization is concept-critical.
- PixiJS: high-density 2D sprites, filters, shaders, and generative fields.
- Rive: supplied interactive state-machine assets; never invent capability
  without a `.riv` asset.
- Three.js/R3F/OGL: real spatial or shader behavior that earns its runtime.
