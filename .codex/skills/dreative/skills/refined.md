# Dreative Specialist Skill — Refined Clean Business

## Contract

Follow `../references/SKILL_CONTRACT.md`. Dependencies: `ux`, `mobile`; add
`media` when photography is a primary material. Deliver a precise type/spacing/
surface system, restrained signature detail, purposeful photography, complete
states, and responsive proof. Do not confuse refined with generic minimalism.
Done means hierarchy, copy, conversion flow, polish, and calm motion hold across
desktop, keyboard, and phone.

Use `../references/REFLEX_FONTS.json` through DESIGN.md's font procedure. Common
product or editorial fonts remain valid when brand continuity, metrics, language,
reference, variable-font capability, or performance specifically earns them;
generic “clean and modern” reasoning does not.

Load this file when `plan.skills` includes `refined`, or the brief/prompt asks
for a "clean modern business site", premium-but-calm marketing, DTC/e-commerce
polish, "professional, not flashy", or names references like ch.maswitzerland.com
or lovvelavva.com. This is the OPPOSITE pole from immersive/cinematic: quality
expressed through restraint — spacing, photography, and type doing all the work,
with motion barely above zero. Most real client work lands here; treat it as a
craft discipline, not the absence of one.

It EXTENDS DESIGN.md (everything applies; this file tightens the dials). It does
NOT stack with `immersive`/`cinematic` — those are different registers. It pairs
well with a light dose of `interaction` (press states, underline draws), the
first tier of `motion` (one hero sequence, 2-3 in-view reveals), `ux` (this
register's audience punishes broken function hardest), and media.md's quiet
treatments only (ken-burns, curtain reveals, one hover-woken loop — imagery
here is generated/sourced to ONE photographic grade, media.md §4).

## 0. The register: expensive silence

What separates premium-clean from generic-clean is not any element — it's the
ratios:

- **Whitespace is the brand.** Section padding 96-160px desktop / 56-80px
  mobile; content max-width 1200-1320px with WIDE outer gutters; one idea per
  viewport. If a section feels empty, that's the look working — resist filling.
- **Photography carries the emotion.** Real product/lifestyle imagery, art-
  directed to one consistent grade (one light temperature, one background
  family). Full-bleed image sections alternate with contained text sections —
  the rhythm image / text / image IS the page structure. Never decorate around
  weak imagery; demand or generate better imagery instead.
- **Type does hierarchy, color stays out of the way.** Near-monochrome palette:
  warm or cool neutral family + ONE accent used almost exclusively on the
  primary CTA and links. Backgrounds shift between 2-3 tints of the neutral
  (e.g. white / #f6f5f2 / #111) to separate sections without borders.
- **Motion whispers.** Motion dial effectively ≤ 4: fade-rise entrances
  (300-400ms, once), a sticky nav that gains a hairline+blur, underline draws,
  press states. No parallax beyond 4%, no pinning, no canvas. A single
  restrained signature (a slow ken-burns on the hero image, or a marquee of
  press logos) is the ceiling.

## 1. Page anatomy (marketing/DTC form)

The proven skeleton — vary the composition per DESIGN.md §5, not the order
logic:

1. **Hero**: one full-width image or split layout; headline ≤ 8 words stating
   the value in plain language; one CTA. No feature bullets in the hero.
2. **Credibility strip**: press/client logos, real marks, grayscale or
   single-tint (lovvelavva runs Forbes/Women's Health/Real Simple here —
   this section converts and belongs high on DTC pages).
3. **Value sections** (2-4): alternating image/text, each making ONE claim
   with 1-2 sentences of support. Icons only if custom-drawn; three-generic-
   icon-cards is the tell this register must avoid most.
4. **Product/collection grid**: large images, generous gaps (24-32px), minimal
   card chrome — image, name, price/one-liner; hover = image swap or subtle
   zoom-crop INSIDE a fixed frame (no card growth).
5. **Social proof**: 1-3 real testimonials with names/photos, editorial layout
   (big quote type), never a 3-card testimonial row.
6. **Closing CTA**: calm full-width section, one sentence, one button.
7. **Footer**: structured, generous, quiet — the footer's polish is a trust
   signal in this register; give it real columns, legal, newsletter.

E-commerce specifics: sticky add-to-cart on product pages (mobile bottom bar),
price always visible, shipping/returns reassurance near the CTA, cart as a
slide-over drawer not a page.

## 2. The discovery-grid variant (cosmos.so-like)

For content/discovery products (galleries, moodboards, catalogs): near-zero
chrome around a masonry/justified image grid; dark or paper-white surface;
images at native aspect ratios (never uniform crops); hover = slight lift +
metadata fade-in on top of the image; infinite scroll with a sentinel loader;
the search/filter bar is the only persistent UI. The product IS the grid —
navigation, branding, and controls stay almost invisible until needed.

## 3. What "modern" means here (2024+, not 2016 flat)

- Hairline borders (1px, 8-12% alpha) instead of shadows for structure; the
  2-3 stacked tinted shadows (interaction.md §3) reserved for genuinely
  floating elements (dropdowns, drawers).
- Larger type than feels safe: body 17-18px on marketing pages, display
  clamped 2.5-4.5rem, tight leading. Small timid type is the #1 dated tell.
- Radius system: one value family — either near-square (2-4px, editorial/
  luxury) or soft (12-16px, DTC/consumer) — never mixed.
- Buttons: solid accent primary + quiet text-link secondary. Pill shape only
  in the consumer/DTC variant. No outlined-button armies.
- Real `<img>`/`<picture>` with proper aspect-ratio boxes; no CSS-drawn
  product mockups; `object-fit: cover` with art-directed focal points.

## 4. Guardrails

- If you're adding an effect to make a section interesting, the section's
  content or imagery is the problem — fix that instead.
- No gradient meshes, no glassmorphism cards, no floating blob backgrounds,
  no emoji in UI copy: all instantly cheapen this register.
- Accessibility floor is easy here — don't squander it: AA contrast on the
  tinted neutrals (test the #767676-gray-on-white trap), visible focus,
  semantic landmarks.
- Performance IS the aesthetic: LCP image preloaded, fonts ≤ 2 files,
  zero animation libraries unless motion is actually used — a clean site
  that loads instantly reads as more premium than any effect.
