description: Frontend design skill + optional visual round-trip editor. Use for DRASTIC frontend change — redesign/restructure/build a section, a page, or the whole site; landing pages; animations, motion, 3D, micro-interactions; "make my UI look good" — and for visual editing when the user says "open dreative" or "let me edit the layout visually". NOT for micro-tweaks (a button color, one label) unless the user explicitly invokes it. Default is direct design: run the mandatory Plan Mode protocol, then apply the design doctrine straight to the codebase. The browser editor (extract → wireframes → edit → apply diff) is an optional mode the user can ask for.

# Dreative — frontend design skill (+ optional visual editor)

You (the coding agent) are the intelligence. Dreative has **two modes**:

- **Mode A — Direct design (default).** The user asks you to design, redesign, restyle, animate, or build UI. Follow the checklist in §A, in order, every time. No server, no extraction, no wireframes.
- **Mode B — Visual round-trip (only when asked).** The user explicitly wants the visual editor ("open dreative", "let me edit visually"). Flow: **extract → baseline → serve requests → finish → apply** (§0–§4 below). Be token-frugal at every step: read only the files you need, never re-read the whole app, and keep JSON compact.

## A. Mode A checklist (do the steps IN ORDER — skipping one is a bug)

1. **Plan — mandatory.** Run the `PLAN.md` protocol (same folder). Never ask *whether* to plan; the only skip is the user explicitly saying "no plan / just do it".
2. **Probe capabilities** (PLAN.md §1): image-gen, video-gen, 3D tooling, browser tools, ffmpeg. Verify by looking — a capability you didn't verify doesn't exist.
3. **Blueprint** (PLAN.md §2): section-by-section table (layout / media plan / motion / interaction / fallback) BEFORE asking the user anything.
4. **Questions — one at a time** (PLAN.md §3): AskUserQuestion, ONE question per call; skip what the prompt already answers clearly, re-ask narrowly what's ambiguous. The pool (incl. the treatments picker and its option list) lives in PLAN.md §3.
5. **Persist the plan** to `.dreative/plan.md` (PLAN.md §4), including the full Q&A transcript and skipped-question inferences.
6. **Mockups** if the user opted in (PLAN.md §4b): 1:1 visual replicas of the 1–2 highest-impact pages; approval gate before real code.
7. **Read the doctrine before code**: `DESIGN.md` + each chosen `skills/<name>.md`, ONCE. Run DESIGN.md §2's explore → commit passes (three divergent concepts, rejects recorded in the plan file; consult the choice ledger at `~/.dreative/ledger.md` if it exists). Commit (one line, to yourself) to register + design read + signature element — can't name all three ⇒ you're about to produce the generic default; stop and commit first.
8. **Assets first** (skills/media.md §1): generate AND edit (grade, crop, loop-cut, poster) every planned asset before section code. Record each in `.dreative/assets.json` (media.md §1) and reuse instead of regenerating.
9. **Build**: foundation (install + WIRE the animation stack, fonts, tokens, providers) → sections in blueprint order → page-level choreography + signature element. The Hard rules below apply throughout. **After the FIRST page is built, write `.dreative/system.md`** — the committed visual system as actually shipped: color tokens, type roles + sizes, radius rule, spacing base, motion vocabulary (the durations/eases in use), icon set, signature element. Every subsequent page — same session, resumed session, or later edit — reads it before designing; "the first page sets the system" only holds if the system survives context loss as a file.
10. **Verify and write `.dreative/verify.md`** (§V). You may not declare done until that file exists with real evidence.
11. **Append the choice ledger**: one line to `~/.dreative/ledger.md` (DESIGN.md §2 — date · project · fonts · palette strategy · signature type · hero concept; create the file if missing).
12. **Report** against the plan — each blueprint row shipped / fallback / cut with reason — and close with the one editor tip: *"Tip: run `dreative start` / say 'open dreative' if you want to tweak this visually."* That's the only place the editor comes up.

### Hard rules (steps 9–10; details live in the named files)

- **Preservation contract** (DESIGN.md §11 — non-negotiable when redesigning existing code): BEFORE editing, build the manifest (every link, id/data-attribute, handler, form field, visible string, data view, conditional state — tabs, modals, auth branches); AFTER, mechanically verify each entry survives and report the ledger. Restructure moves things; it never loses them.
- **Depth honesty** (DESIGN.md §11): a confirmed restructure/reimagine rebuilds markup, component trees, and routing for real — never just restyles the old skeleton.
- **Real motion engineering** (skills/motion.md): chosen motion/3d/immersive/cinematic treatments ship with the proper libraries (GSAP + ScrollTrigger, Lenis, `motion/react`, three.js/R3F) — dependencies actually installed (`npm i gsap lenis` …), providers/render loops wired, choreography built. A static page with a few CSS transitions does not fulfill a motion request; the shipped result must clear motion.md §9's inventory.
- **No static media** (skills/media.md §0): a bare `background-image` or `<img>` behind text is a failure — every image/video gets an entrance/idle/response treatment (reveal, dissolve, pixel-develop, hover-wake, media plane…) and is edited/graded to the page before shipping. At award-site ambition, media planes with scroll-driven shader response are MANDATORY for hero + key gallery imagery (media.md §3). Generated media per DESIGN.md §7 — hero imagery, textures, seamless video loops woven into the motion system — is among the highest-impact upgrades available.
- **No coded organic 3D** (skills/3d.md §3): never model a real-world organic/textured object from primitives — realistic 3D subjects use a real GLB or a cutout image billboard (generated, or a sourced/matted photo when no image-gen tool exists); coded geometry is for abstract forms only and must carry real texture maps (generated, sourced, or procedural-shader). This ban is tool-independent: a missing image-gen MCP means the organic 3D element gets CUT or replaced (3d.md §3 rung 4), never coded from primitives.
- **References are studied, never guessed.** Screenshots/images → read with image tools, extract palette/type/layout/motion cues. URLs → fetch (browser tools or web fetch; look at real script/font/class evidence). Videos → watch only if tooling allows (PLAN.md §3's optional video-MCP offer); otherwise work from the user's description and say so.

## V. Verification (Mode A — evidence file required, mobile first)

Doctrine at write-time is weaker than judgment at review-time, and screenshots alone cannot catch broken function — a dead WebGL canvas, a menu that won't close, an invisible layer eating clicks all screenshot fine. Verification is TWO stages (plus a comparative critique at expressive+ ambition), all mandatory, and it produces a FILE: write `.dreative/verify.md` recording the evidence below (screenshot paths, console summary, transform samples with values, audit results, rubric grades, fallbacks taken). **"Done" without `verify.md` is not done.** Run every check at **~390px mobile width FIRST** (most real traffic is mobile, and it's where motion-heavy builds break), then desktop.

*Stage 1 — runtime gates (functional).* Run the app with browser tools and prove the page WORKS: (a) **console clean** — zero uncaught errors/unhandled rejections while loading, scrolling the full page, and interacting; (b) **effects provably running** — if WebGL shipped, the canvas has a live context and draws (not black/blank); if animations shipped, sample a moving element's transform twice ~500ms apart and confirm it changes (record both values in verify.md), and confirm scroll triggers fire at their positions — **but for image/media elements at dial ≥ 6, a sample whose only delta is uniform scale, translate, or opacity is NOT treatment evidence: that pattern IS the banned ken-burns/fade floor (media.md §0). Media evidence must name the mechanism and show it changing — clip-path/mask values mid-scroll, diverging parallax-layer offsets, a sampled shader uniform, a hover-response property — one line per hero/key image in verify.md, and a page whose per-image lines are all scale/opacity deltas fails item 10 below**; if video shipped, confirm `!video.paused` and the poster shows pre-play; (c) **interaction smoke test** — run `skills/ux.md` §7's functional audit (click nav links, open/close the mobile menu, submit a form invalid+valid, tab through, hit-test controls inside effect-heavy regions); (d) the mobile pass per `skills/mobile.md` §5 when mobile shipped; (e) **performance gate** (whenever WebGL, video, or heavy scroll choreography shipped — always at award-site ambition): scroll the full page and watch for stutter — sample `requestAnimationFrame` deltas for a few seconds of scrolling (via the console/javascript tool) and flag sustained frames > 33ms; check total transferred weight against the tier budget (~3–5MB initial at award-site, less below); record both numbers in verify.md. A janky award-site is worse than a smooth expressive one — jank routes to the same failure doctrine as a broken effect (fix, tier down per DESIGN.md §13's tiering, or ship the planned fallback). **Failure doctrine:** any effect that fails a runtime gate is fixed or replaced with its planned fallback (PLAN.md §2) before done — never shipped broken, never silently removed; verify.md and the final report name what fell back and why.

*Stage 2 — visual self-critique.* Screenshot at ~390px mobile AND desktop, then grade the screenshots against this rubric — (1) would a stranger name the brand's register and audience from one glance? (2) does it pass DESIGN.md §2's slop tests *as rendered* (not as intended)? (3) is the signature element actually visible, working, and honoring its commit mini-spec (right driver, brand-native — not swapped for a generic effect mid-build)? (4) spatial integrity per DESIGN.md §15 — scan for anything overlapping anything else: controls covered, rows/text clipped at an edge, floating widgets fighting for a corner, fixed bars hiding content; overlap failures outrank aesthetic ones — fix them first? (4b) any contrast failure, unloaded font/image, or motion jank? (5) does mobile hold up per DESIGN.md §13? (6) preservation ledger clean — every link, action, form field, text string, and tab/modal/state from the manifest present or logged as intentional? (7) if motion treatments were chosen: are the animation libraries actually installed and imported, and can you name ≥3 specific shipped animations (element + trigger + duration) visible in the running page? (8) if generated media shipped: posters present, loops playing, treatments wired per `skills/media.md` §5's floors? (9) **object honesty** — screenshot every custom 3D element and ask: would a stranger name it as the real object it claims to be (a coffee bean, a bottle), or does it read as an untextured blob/primitive? A blob FAILS: replace it with the cutout-billboard rung of 3d.md §3 (or cut it) before done. This check is answered with MECHANICAL evidence, not adjectives: quote the material line from the scene code in verify.md and confirm it carries a texture map or custom shader (3d.md §3's texture test) — writing "textured/physical/sculptural roast core" over a flat-color primitive is self-deception the screenshot won't argue with, and the subject test goes by what the plan/copy says the element represents, not what the code names it. (10) at motion dial ≥ 6 / expressive ambition and up: do hero + key section images each have a scroll- or cursor-DRIVEN treatment (media.md §0's zoom/fade-floor rule) — fade-in + ken-burns everywhere fails, sourced/stock images included; at dial ≥ 7 additionally: does the planned media SET-PIECE (media.md §0 — tornado/vortex, disintegration, shatter, living overlay…) provably run (named element + driver + evidence)? A page of uniformly quiet treatments with no set-piece fails; at award-site ambition additionally: is at least one image provably a scroll-reactive media plane (media.md §3's sampled-uniform evidence in verify.md)? All images flat/static ⇒ the tier is not met. (11) **wholeheartedness, dial ≥ 7 / expressive+** — re-count PLAN.md §2's mechanism-diversity quota against what actually SHIPPED (≥4 distinct mechanisms, ≥3 distinct drivers, none used more than twice; tallies in verify.md); confirm plan.md records the entropy draw (literal command + output) and the rolled provocation is visibly on the page, not token-gestured; then name the THREE moments a visitor would screenshot or describe to someone — if you can't name three, the page is compliant, not designed: build them before done. A build where every media/motion item sits exactly at its rule's minimum is a failed build at this tier — floors are where fallbacks land, never where designs aim. Fix what fails and re-check once; grades go in verify.md.

*Stage 2b — comparative critique (expressive/award-site ambition).* Rubrics catch rule-breaks; they can't measure taste. Put the desktop screenshot next to the closest reference actually studied for this build — the user's reference if one was given, else the nearest calibration site from PLAN.md §3 (fetch/screenshot it now if browser tools exist) — and name the THREE biggest gaps between yours and theirs (type confidence, spacing rhythm, motion cohesion, image quality, compositional courage…). Fix what's fixable in this pass; log each gap + action (fixed / accepted with reason) in verify.md. "No meaningful gaps" is almost never the honest answer — finding none means look harder.

*§9 hard gate (expressive/award-site ambition).* motion.md §9's shipped-motion inventory is a completion gate, not a checklist: for the chosen dial, every inventory item must be either PROVEN running by Stage 1 (named element + trigger + evidence in verify.md) or logged in verify.md as a deliberate cut with the reason. An item that is merely absent — no evidence, no cut-reason — means the task is NOT done: build it (or its PLAN.md fallback), then re-verify; never report done with an unexplained §9 gap. Grade the mobile pass against the shifted dial (mobile.md maps desktop dial N to mobile N−2), not the desktop inventory.

If you cannot run the app or screenshot (no browser available), say so explicitly and degrade honestly: walk the rendered DOM/CSS mentally against both stages' rubrics, grep for the runtime-gate evidence (imports wired, providers mounted, pointer-events on overlay layers, fallback branches present), and record in verify.md which gates could NOT be verified — never silently skip the pass.

## Doctrine (applies to BOTH modes)

**Design quality is a hard requirement.** `DESIGN.md` (same folder as this file) is the design doctrine. Read it ONCE before servicing the first `propose-skeletons`, `propose-variants`, `design-page`, or `edit-element` request, keep it in mind for all later ones, and run its pre-flight checklist (§12) before every respond. Requests may carry a `brief` object (aesthetic preset + vibe + dials set by the user in the UI); when present it is the user's explicit direction and overrides doctrine defaults. Before writing any `design-page` code, state (to yourself, one line) the register, the design read, and the signature element — if you cannot name all three, you are about to produce the generic default; stop and commit first.

**Specialist skills.** The `skills/` folder next to this file holds expert playbooks for advanced work: `motion.md` (animation & scroll choreography), `3d.md` (WebGL/three.js/shaders), `interaction.md` (micro-interactions & effect craft), `immersive.md` (award-site worlds, spatial page transitions, scroll-as-journey), `cinematic.md` (dark shader-graded experiential interfaces: fluid/particle surfaces, drag-to-explore, click & hold, sound design — opt-in aesthetic), `refined.md` (premium clean business/DTC/e-commerce: restraint, photography, whitespace — the calm pole), `media.md` (generated images/video as motion material: production pipeline, DOM and WebGL media treatments, media planes), `ux.md` (the working-page contract: nav, forms, states, keyboard, pointer-events audit — load for any product-register page), `mobile.md` (mobile as a first-class surface: calm-premium motion translation, ergonomics, mobile verification). All are universal: they apply directly to any codebase in Mode A; the editor is never required. When a request's `plan.skills` lists names, read each listed `skills/<name>.md` ONCE before writing code (then keep it in mind, like DESIGN.md); when `plan.sections[].skills` tags a section, that section gets that treatment (e.g. "this hero has 3d"). If the brief/prompt clearly calls for one of these but the plan missed it, read it anyway. If a listed file isn't installed, proceed on DESIGN.md alone and note it to the user (`dreative install-skill` installs all).

Everything below describes Mode B.

## 0. Setup

Requires `dreative` on PATH (`npm i -g dreative` or `npx dreative`). All commands run from the user's project root. State lives in `.dreative/` (paths in payloads are relative to `.dreative/`).

## 1. Extract (code → layout + replica)

Goal: replicate the app's current UI **view-by-view** so the user recognizes every screen. Do this **one page at a time** — find the routes/pages first (router config, pages/ dir, app/ dir), then open only each page's component files. **Single pass per page:** while the source is in front of you, produce all three outputs at once (layout JSON, replica file, summaries) — never revisit a file for a second output.

**One Dreative page per VIEW, not per route file.** If a route renders mutually-exclusive views — tab panels, admin vs viewer modes, auth states, wizard steps, a modal that fills the screen — each view becomes its own Dreative page. A page's layout must show exactly what the user sees at one moment; never stack multiple tab panels' content into one layout. Name split views `"<Screen> — <View>"` (e.g. "Admin Studio — Library", "Admin Studio — Ranking Board"), give them the same `source`, the same `group` (e.g. `"group": "Admin Studio"`), and cluster them on the canvas. Shared chrome (header, tab bar) repeats in each view's layout, with the active tab noted in its `text`.

**Expose hidden UI.** UI that exists but isn't visible by default must still surface, or the user gets a wrong picture of their app:
- *Full-screen or view-sized* hidden UI (modals, dialogs, drawers, overlay panels with real content) → its own Dreative page, grouped with its parent screen (e.g. "Library — Edit Show modal").
- *Small* hidden UI (dropdown menus, tooltips-with-actions, hover-revealed buttons, expandable rows) → model it as a block **inside its trigger's parent**, labeled for what it is (e.g. label "Sort dropdown (opens on click)"), with a `summary` saying when it appears. Don't invent open-state visuals in the replica — the replica shows the default state; the layout is where hidden things are enumerated.

**Fidelity is the whole point.** The wireframe and replica must be recognizable as *that* page at a glance. Model every visible major section in order — hero/banner, search+filter bars, stat/KPI rows, each shelf/carousel with its cards, footers. A real page with 8 visible sections must yield ~8 top-level children, not 3 generic boxes. Card grids get realistic counts (a shelf showing 7 posters → a card-grid the user reads as a row of posters, with real show titles in `text`). Before moving on, self-check: *would the user, seeing only this wireframe, name which page of their app it is?* If not, you under-extracted — fix it before the next page.

Per page, produce:

1. **Layout** — the block tree in `project.json` (schema below).
2. **Replica** — `.dreative/replica/<pageId>.tsx`: a stripped, non-functional **1:1 visual copy** of the real page. Single file, default export, no imports beyond react, Tailwind classes (translate other styling to Tailwind or inline styles). Strip everything behavioral: no handlers, no hooks, no data fetching; replace dynamic state/props with representative literal values (the ones a real user would see). It only needs to LOOK identical, not work. Every block id from the layout appears as `data-dreative-id="<id>"` on the matching element. Set `replicaFile` on the page.
3. **Summaries** — on each meaningful block, `summary`: one plain line of what it shows or does ("Submits the signup form and redirects to /dashboard", "Lists the 6 most recent orders from the API"). These render as hover tooltips in the replica so the user understands behavior without you re-reading code later, and they are your own re-entry notes at apply time. Keep each under ~120 chars.

Write `.dreative/project.json`:

```json
{ "version": 1, "brief": { "aesthetic": "minimal", "vibe": "", "audience": "", "variance": 7, "motion": 5, "density": 4, "notes": "" }, "pages": [ {
  "id": "pg_home", "name": "Home", "canvasPos": {"x": 40, "y": 40},
  "theme": { "bg": "#0d0d0f", "fg": "#e8e8ea", "accent": "#f59e0b" },
  "status": "skeleton", "source": "src/pages/Home.tsx",
  "layout": { "id": "blk_root", "type": "section", "label": "Home", "direction": "column", "children": [ … ] }
} ] }
```

(page objects also take `"replicaFile": "replica/pg_home.tsx"` and `"group": "Admin Studio"` for split views of one screen)

Block: `{ id, type, label, text?, summary?, direction?, sizeHint?, source?, children? }`
- `type`: section | row | column | nav | hero | card-grid | list | form | footer | text | image | button
- `label`: short recognizable name (shown on hover/inspector).
- `text`: the **actual visible copy** (heading text, button caption, first ~80 chars of a paragraph) — set it on every text/button/hero leaf; it renders verbatim in the wireframe so the user recognizes the page.
- Page `theme` `{bg, fg, accent}`: pull the real CSS colors (page background, main text color, brand accent) so the wireframe card matches the app's look. Set it on every page.
- `source`: the real file that owns this block (component path). Set it on every block whose owner differs from its parent's — this is what lets you apply the diff later without re-searching.
- Keep depth sensible (3–5 levels); every meaningful visible element should exist, but don't model every span.
- Ids must be unique and stable; prefix `pg_`/`blk_` plus a slug.
- Space pages on the canvas: x += 480 per page.
- Top-level `brief` is optional at extraction time (the user edits it in the UI); if the app has an obvious existing aesthetic, seed it so redesigns preserve the brand.

Then snapshot the baseline: `dreative baseline` (start the server first, step 2, if not running).

## 2. Launch

```
dreative start   # serves http://localhost:4820, opens browser (background this)
```

Tell the user the UI is open: they can view the **Replica** tab (1:1 copy of their real page, hover shows your summaries), drag elements in **Layout**, add/remove blocks, set the **Design brief** (preset + dials), attach reference images and prompts, hit **🎨 Design all**, and click **Finish** when done.

## 3. Service requests (the wait loop)

Repeat until finish:

```
dreative wait    # blocks up to ~8 min; prints ONE event as JSON
```

- `{"kind":"none"}` → just run `dreative wait` again.
- `{"kind":"request","id","type","payload"}` → handle per table below, then
  `dreative respond <id> <resultFile>` (write the result JSON to a temp file) or `dreative respond <id> --error "why"`.
- `{"kind":"finish","diff":…}` → go to step 4.

| type | payload | result to respond with |
|---|---|---|
| `propose-skeletons` | `{prompt, brief?}` | Array of 1–3 `{name, layout}` page proposals (block schema above), structured per DESIGN.md layout rules |
| `propose-variants` | `{pageName, layout, brief?}` | Array of 1–3 `{name, layout}` variants |
| `edit-block` | `{block, instruction}` | The updated block JSON (same id) |
| `design-page` | `{pageName, layout, brief?, plan?, refImage?, blockRefs, designPrompt?, previousFile?, siblingPages, outFile}` | Write a single-file React+Tailwind component (default export, no imports beyond react) to `.dreative/<outFile>`; every block id in layout must appear as `data-dreative-id="<id>"`. **`plan` is Dreative's pre-computed design decision — execute it, don't re-decide:** it carries resolved dials, a layout family per section (`plan.sections`, sections may carry `skills` tags like `["3d"]`), spacing/motion budgets (`plan.directives`), doctrine violations to fix (`plan.lints`), and required specialist skills (`plan.skills` → read `skills/<name>.md` first). DESIGN.md still governs everything the plan doesn't specify. Read `refImage`/`blockRefs[].refImage` (paths under `.dreative/`) with your image tools; if `previousFile` set, read it and preserve prior element edits. Respond `{"ok":true}` |
| `edit-element` | `{file, elementId, instruction, refImage?}` | Edit `.dreative/<file>` in place, only the element with `data-dreative-id=elementId`, keeping DESIGN.md rules intact. Respond `{"ok":true}` |

A "Design all pages" click in the UI arrives as one `design-page` request per page, back to back: keep visual consistency across them (same accent, type scale, radius system — the first page you design sets the system for the rest). Persist that system to `.dreative/system.md` after the first page and re-read it before each later page or `edit-element`, so consistency survives session boundaries.

Token rules: only read ref images when a request names them; never dump whole files into responses; for edits, edit files directly instead of returning code.

## 4. Apply (finish)

The finish event's `diff` (also saved at `.dreative/finish.json`) contains only what changed vs the baseline:

- `pagesAdded` — full layouts; create real pages/components for them.
- `pagesRemoved` — confirm with the user before deleting real code.
- `pagesChanged` — per page: `blocksMoved` (reorder in the source), `blocksAdded`, `blocksRemoved`, `blocksChanged` (only differing props listed; `refImage` = style reference to match, `intents` = behavior notes), plus page-level `refImage`/`designPrompt`.

Use each block's/page's `source` pointer to open **only the owning files**, and each block's `summary` to recall what an element does **without re-reading unrelated code**. Read annotated ref images now (paths relative to `.dreative/`). Make the real code match the final layout and annotations, run the project's checks, and summarize what you changed.
